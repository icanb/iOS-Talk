##Good Practices for iOS Development##

This repo contains the keynote file and sample code for Intro to iOS talk I've given on 09/09/2012.

Duration: 1.5 hrs

The slides doesn't contain much since the presentation was heavily based on demonstration.

We went through 2 different samples

###1) Schedule###

This was a schedule app with some basic table, table controller and another view with details of item on the schedule.

###2) Schedule with Core Data###

This was an extension to previously mentioned schedule app. This time we stored the information about the newly added/removed content on the device using Core Data.

The best way to do this is to use NSFetchedResultsController, however, we haven't used it for the sake of simplicity.
